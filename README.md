# BBC Microbit Examples

## Introduction

This is my testing ground for the BBC Microbit.
I'm using micropython, via the [mu](https://github.com/ntoll/mu)
editor.

I've done almost no python programming before so my code is unlikely
to be very elegant.
My goal is to explore the possibilities so that when these are rolled
out to school kids then I've at least got some idea of its
capabilities.
